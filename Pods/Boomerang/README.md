# ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

Boomerang is currently under development. It can be used in production projects but breaking changes may occur until we reach v1.0
Documentation is on its way :)

## What is it?

Boomerang's main objective is to help developers to quickly build apps in a standard and clean way.
It enforces an architecture based on SOLID principles, implementing the MVVM pattern with some concepts from VIPER architecture and steering away from M(assive)VC.

With a clean architecture in mind it's easier to quickly and harmlessly port an iOS app to macOS/tvOS and vice-versa, without affecting the business logic and the model logic of the entire software. At the end, the differences between platforms in a cross platform software should always be a matter of views.

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+ / Mac OS X 10.11+ / tvOS 9.0+ / watchOS 3.0+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 3.0+

# Before we begin

Boomerang is a framework, something that will heavily impact on your codebase and on how you design your app. It's not a drag'n'drop library addressing a single task. It requires some basic understanding of what problem is trying to solve and what tools are involved in the process.
